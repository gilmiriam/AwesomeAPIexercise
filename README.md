# API Exercise

We have an API proposal for make the management of users of a database. In order 
to do that we need to satisfy 3 possible scenarios:

- Create new users
- Update existing users
- Delete users

The considerations for the exercises are:
- The application have to be well tested in order to cover all
edge cases and not only the happy path

- Well constructed architecture

- We need something simple but scalable
